Go has an inbuilt functionality called the escape analysis that decides whether a particular variable
should be allocated to stack or the heap

we can print escape analysis info using "-gcflags" flag followed -m when running either go build or go run
commands

'-m' is the function in gcflags that instructs the escape analysis info to get printed
