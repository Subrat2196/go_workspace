Inlining decisions in programming is an optimization that involves replacing a a function call site 
with the body of the called function.
Inlining decisions refer to choices made by the compiler to opimize the run

Inlining means wherever functions are called it will inline it near to main,or on top of main,
so that we can save the time to jump to a particular function as it's just above use
