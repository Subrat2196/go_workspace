Concurrency and parallelism are related but different concepts in Programming

Concurrency is a way to write code using concurrent design pattern and only after that if we have multiple
cores in computers and we can run that code parallely in multiple cores.

Using concurrency we can create goroutines and goroutines can run on their own
like independent programs e.g func main is a goroutine and we can have many like it that
can run concurrently to that

e.g 

go func() {
    time.Sleep(d1 * time.Millisecond)
    ch1 <- 42
}()

The above statements makes a goroutine sleep for some time and
 after that pushes value 41 to channel 1

creating channels :- 
ch1 := make(chan int)
ch2 := make(chan int)
