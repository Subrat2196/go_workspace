A hash algorithm is a mathematical function that takes in a variable sized input, such as a file
or message, and produces a fixed-size output, known as a hash or digest.
A small change in I/P produces an entirely diff output
Therefore hashes are very good to know if anything changed in the i/p

When a user enters a password it's hashed and stored in database 
and everytime the user logs in again then your i/p is checked with the hashed password you 
created the first time
