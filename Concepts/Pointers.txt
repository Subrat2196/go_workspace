How to computers store memory?

It's like a locker in dressing rooms
(each locker has a number(address),space,lock)

Pointer is a variable that holds the memory address

Pointer Semantics vs Value Semantics -> pointer semantics means when the address
of a variable is passed to a function , value semantics means when a value of a variable
is passed to a function

Pointer and Value Heuristics

Value semantics should be used as much possible, only if mandated use pointer semantics, since 
if error comes somewhere we dont want every function to point to a particular place

Pointer semantics are used for large data (64 B or more)

Stack is a self cleaning data structure
Heap is an expensive DS and requires garbage collection
